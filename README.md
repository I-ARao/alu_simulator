# 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) built on NEXYS A7 FPGA with Seven Segment Support

### Problem Statement:

Designing and implementing an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for a specific function and replicating the output on a seven-segment display using a Nexys 4 A7 FPGA board.

### Installation

##### Note: You must have Vivado installed on to your personal computer or VM. Note that before you can run Vivado (or any Xilinx tool), you must add them to your PATH.
```source /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2020.2/settings64.sh```
You can then run Vivado with the command:
```vivado```

##### Main Installation:

Now, you can run the code on your local machine (and on the FPGA connected to your machine) by running:

```vivado -source alu_simulator.tcl```
